# Make sure to update the credential placeholders with your own secrets.
# We mark them with # CHANGEME in the file below.
# In addition, we recommend to restrict inbound traffic on the host to langfuse-web (port 3000) and minio (port 9090) only.
# All other components are bound to localhost (127.0.0.1) to only accept connections from the local machine.
# External connections from other machines will not be able to reach these services directly.
